# team-management-fe

This project is created using Ember.js application, which is a frontend for managing teams and their members. The application interacts with a Loopback API [Team Management App - Backend](https://github.com/Firmanrachmad/team-management-BE) to fetch and manage data related to teams and members.

## Features

- **Team Management**: Create, read, update, and delete teams.
- **Member Management**: Create, read, update, and delete members within teams.
- **Data Fetching**: The application fetches data from a Loopback API.


## Approach

* **Components**: Reusable components were created to manage the UI for teams and members.
* **Routes**: Routes were set up to handle navigation between different views (e.g., listing teams, adding a new team).
* **Templates**: Handlebars templates were used to render the UI, with data binding to dynamically display team and member information.
* **Data Fetching**: The application fetches data from a Loopback API.
